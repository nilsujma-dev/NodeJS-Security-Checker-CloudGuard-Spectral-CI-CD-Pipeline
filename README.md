## Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline for Node.js Security Analysis with Check Point CloudGuard and Spectral

This GitHub repository presents a Jenkins pipeline, intricately designed to analyze the latest Node.js image from DockerHub for vulnerabilities, secrets, and misconfigurations. The pipeline employs Check Point CloudGuard and Spectral scanning tools to comprehensively assess and report on the security posture of the Node.js Docker image.

### Pipeline Objectives
1. **In-Depth Security Analysis**: The primary goal is to identify and understand the full spectrum of security issues in the latest Node.js Docker image, including vulnerabilities, exposed secrets, and potential misconfigurations.
2. **Latest Node.js Image Assessment**: Focuses on the latest version of the Node.js image from DockerHub, ensuring the analysis covers the most up-to-date release.
3. **Comprehensive Scanning with CloudGuard and Spectral**: Utilizes the advanced capabilities of CloudGuard and Spectral to perform a thorough security assessment.

### Detailed Pipeline Stages
1. **Repository Cloning and Preparation**: Retrieves the necessary scripts and configuration from the GitHub repository.
2. **Spectral Setup and Scans**: Installs Spectral and conducts pre- and post-build scans, focusing on secrets detection, open-source software vulnerabilities, and infrastructure as code issues.
3. **Docker Image Build for Node.js**: Constructs a Docker image for the latest Node.js version and saves it locally.
4. **ShiftLeft Scans**: Executes ShiftLeft scans in both online and offline modes to analyze the Docker image for a comprehensive range of security vulnerabilities.
5. **Results Analysis and Reporting**: Captures and reports on the findings from Spectral and ShiftLeft, offering a detailed view of the security status of the latest Node.js image.

### Importance of This Pipeline
